## Specific Aims for our suite of smartphone apps
Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) affects millions of people around the world and takes different forms. Most people with OCD face barriers to personalized therapy but do have access to a smartphone. Digital versions of behavior modification therapies in smartphone app form hold promise for helping people with OCD. A search for “OCD” across app stores results in a listing of thousands of apps that include “OCD” in their descriptions, but which if any of these apps have scientific or clinical support is unclear. Careful evaluation of apps in a clinical setting is needed, but the vast majority of app developers do not have access to clinicians or patients, nor the expertise or intent to run clinical research experiments.

To address this problem, we are creating a suite of OCD smartphone apps in partnership with
clinical colleagues at the Child Mind Institute (CMI) and Child Mind Medical Practice (CMMP),
who are interested in rigorously evaluating such apps to extend therapy to the home.
The apps are digital renditions of therapies conducted at the CMMP. Since there are many
barriers to coming to the clinic (time, distance, stigma, etc.), an app could provide a means
of monitoring behaviors associated with OCD between clinic visits, such as reassurance seeking,
checking and tapping. Web browser-based data visualizations of app data will enable clinical
researchers to understand the timing, duration, and frequency of these behaviors in a convenient,
non-intrusive manner. We propose to refine and test these apps for behavior monitoring and
intervention:

### Aim 1 will test the usability and engagement of OCD apps by patients and clinicians.
We will recruit children with OCD who come for anxiety treatment at the CMMP.
We will engage each of these children, their respective parents and clinicians in structured
interviews and surveys before, during and after use of the apps to determine what refinements
are needed in the apps to best deliver therapy to children with OCD.

### Aim 2 will test the clinical efficacy of the apps as part of a behavior modification therapy. 
We will recruit a second group of children with OCD at CMMP and have them install an app on
their phones (if they have a phone) and/or their parents’ phones. Each child will use the app
at home during the course of their therapy, and we will use the apps to independently quantify
the severity of their OCD symptoms over time. Group 1 will use an app between clinic visits and
receive feedback about their progress with the app from a clinician; group 2 will use the app
but not receive feedback about their app progress (from the same clinician, who will not
monitor app progress); group 3 will undergo therapy without use of the app.

### Aim 3 will test the utility of self reports and physiological signals to predict OCD severity.
Combining data acquired from the apps with other contextual information, such as state of
arousal and emotional state, we may be able to better predict severity of OCD symptoms over time.
To provide this multimodal context, we will have participants wear a device to collect
electrodermal activity (Empatica’s Embrace watch), and have them periodically fill out self
reports administered via mobile phone (ecological momentary assessments).

If use of the OCD apps helps to reduce their OCD-related behavior more than participants not
using the app, this would demonstrate the viability of smartphone-based intervention as a means
of OCD therapy. It would also represent the first time such behaviors are reliably, objectively,
and quantitatively measured and documented remotely. Widespread use of such apps could
facilitate future therapies with reduced dependence on clinicians, enabling the millions of
people with OCD access to means to monitor their compulsive behaviors and to intervene on
their own behalves.
