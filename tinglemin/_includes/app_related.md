In previous work, we helped to develop the mPower smartphone app on top of Apple’s ResearchKit
([Bot et al., 2016](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.11))
which tracks cognitive, behavioral, mood, physiological states, etc.
([Chaibub Neto et al., 2016](https://dx.doi.org/10.1142/9789814749411_0026)).
We also created an automated, open source software pipeline for extracting features from
smartphone sensor data. Currently, we are building wearable devices for tracking symptoms of
psychiatric illness and are collecting wearable device biometric data alongside brain MRI, EEG,
eye tracking, audio, and video as part of [the Child Mind Institute’s Healthy Brain Network
study of 10,000 children](http://www.healthybrainnetwork.org/).

## Opportunity for technologically mediated intervention
It is only recently that sensor-based technologies such as smartphones have been used to track
mental health, most notably through the launch of iPhone apps such as the mPower app built on
top of Apple’s ResearchKit ([Bot et al., 2016](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.11)).
Smartphones and wearable devices have the potential to collect cognitive, behavioral, mood,
and physiological data using active and passive data collection methods. Active methods
include explicit self reports, from occasional and detailed survey instruments to more frequent
and brief interactions, sometimes referred to as “ecological momentary assessments,” as well as
the performance of tasks probing various domains of function (e.g., memory). Passive methods
usually involve sensor-based data collection to collect objective, real-world data about
participants to track cognitive, behavioral, mood, and physiological states, detect medication
response, etc. ([Chaibub Neto et al., 2016](https://dx.doi.org/10.1142/9789814749411_0026)),
in ways that could never be achieved before
([Adams et al., 2016](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2016.10.019);
[Glenn & Monteith, 2014](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11920-014-0494-4);
[Maetzler, Domingos, Srulijes, Ferreira, & Bloem, 2013](https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.25628)).
The repetitive nature of behaviors associated with OCD provide an ideal testbed for smartphone
application-based monitoring and intervention strategies.
